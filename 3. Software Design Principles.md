# Introduction to Clean Code and Software Design Principles

Code is clean when it is easily readable by developers other than the original author as well.

Writing clean code might seem like an overhead at the beginning. But it allows us to maintain and develop a piece of software fast in the long term.

## How to write a Clean Code?

We can write clean code by following a set of guidelines known as Software Design Principles. Software Design Principles is a set of guidelines proven to work over the years.

A few of the broad guidelines to write clean, readable and maintainable code are:

-   Meaningful variable names, functions, classes etc.
-   Proper Comments
-   Modular Code Structure (Encapsulation)
-   Functions
    -   The name of the function should depict the entire functionality of the function.
    -   Max lines in a function should be limit in such a way that a single function should completely fit inside a screen.
    -   A single function should attain only one single objective / functionality.
-   Limit on no. of characters in a single line of code.
-   Structure of code should be properly indented, readable, and simple.

## Basic Software Design Principles (DRY, KISS, YAGNI etc.)

Software Design Principles are a certain set of guidelines and principles, through which we can achieve a clean code which is easiliy readable by other developer.

### DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)

-   **Every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system.** This means that, you must try to maintain the behavior of a functionality of the system in a single piece of code, it should not have duplicated code or design item.
    <br>

-   It’s easier to maintain a code or system that is only in one place, because if you need to change something in the code or system, you just need to change in one place.
    <br>

-   Besides that, if you have the same code in two or more places, the code can be change during the time, and when this happens it will become bugs in your system. Duplicated code also makes the code more complex and unnecessarily larger.
    <br>

-   The way to achieve DRY is by creating functions and classes to make sure that any logic should be written in only one place.

### Curly's Law - Do One Thing

-   Curly's Law is about choosing a single, clearly defined goal for any particular bit of code: Do One Thing.
    <br>

-   **Curly's Law :** An entity (class, function, variable) should mean one thing, and one thing only. It should not mean one thing in one circumstance and carry a different value from a different domain some other time. It should not mean two things at once. It should mean One Thing and should mean it all of the time.

### KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid)

-   The KISS principle states that most systems work best if they are kept simple rather than made complicated; therefore, simplicity should be a key goal in design, and unnecessary complexity should be avoided.
    <br>

-   Simple code has the following benefits:

    -   less time to write
    -   less chances of bugs
    -   easier to understand, debug and modify
        <br>

-   Do the simplest thing that could possibly work.

### Don't Make Me Think

-   Code should be easy to read and understand without much thinking. If it isn't then there is a prospect of simplification.

### You Aren't Gonna Need It (YAGNI)

-   **You Aren't Gonna Need It (YAGNI)** is an **Extreme Programming (XP)** practice which states: **"Always implement things when you actually need them, never when you just foresee that you need them."**
    <br>

-   Even if you're totally, totally, totally sure that you'll need a feature, later on, don't implement it now. Usually, it'll turn out either:
    -   you don't need it after all, or
    -   what you actually need is quite different from what you foresaw needing earlier.
        <br>

This doesn't mean you should avoid building flexibility into your code. It means you shouldn't overengineer something based on what you think you might need later on.
<br>

There are two main reasons to practice **YAGNI :**

-   You save time because you avoid writing code that you turn out not to need.
-   Your code is better because you avoid polluting it with '**guesses**' that turn out to be more or less wrong but stick around anyway.

### Premature Optimization is the Root of All Evil

-   Programmers waste enormous amounts of time thinking about or worrying about, the speed of noncritical parts of their programs, and these attempts at efficiency actually have a strong negative impact when debugging and maintenance are considered.

### Boy-Scout Rule

-   Any time someone sees some code that isn't as clear as it should be, they should take the opportunity to fix it right there and then - or at least within a few minutes.
    <br>

-   This opportunistic refactoring is referred to by Uncle Bob as following the boy-scout rule - **always leave the code behind in a better state than you found it.**
    <br>

-   The code quality tends to degrade with each change. This results in technical debt. The Boy-Scout Principle saves us from that.

### Code for the Maintainer

-   Code maintenance is an expensive and difficult process. Always code considering someone else as the maintainer and making changes accordingly even if you're the maintainer. After a while, you'll remember the code as much as a stranger.
    <br>

-   Always code as if the person who ends up maintaining your code is a violent psychopath who knows where you live.

### Principle of Least Astonishment

-   Principle of Least Astonishment states that a component of a system should behave in a way that most users will expect it to behave. The behavior should not astonish or surprise users.
    <br>

-   Code should do what the name and comments suggest. Conventions should be followed. Surprising side effects should be avoided as much as possible.

## Software Design Principles | Abstraction, Extensibility, Cohesion

### Hide Implementation Details | Abstraction

-   Hiding implementation details helps to make changes in a component without making changes in the other modules/clients using that component. This can be achieved by creating interfaces and using them instead of the concrete classes.
    <br>

-   Encapsulation with proper access management should also be done to expose only the required public functions.

### Separation of Concerns (SoC) | Encapsulation

-   Separation of concerns (SoC) is a design principle for separating a computer program into distinct sections such that each section addresses a separate concern.
    <br>

-   A program that embodies SoC well is called a modular program. Modularity, and hence separation of concerns, is achieved by creating well-encapsulated classes that have well-defined interfaces.
    <br>

-   We should strive to separate the program into separate sections such that the overlap is as minimal as possible. SoC helps maintenance and also code reuse.

### Maximize Cohesion

-   **Cohesion** is the degree to how strongly related and focused are the various responsibilities of a module. It is a measure of the strength of the relationship between the class’s methods and data themselves. We should strive to maximize cohesion. High cohesion results in better understanding, maintaining, and reusing components.
    <br>

-   Cohesion is increased if:
    -   The functionalities embedded in a class, accessed through its methods, have much in common.
    -   Methods carry out a small number of related activities, by avoiding coarsely grained or unrelated sets of data.
    -   Related methods are in the same source file or otherwise grouped together; for example, in separate files but in the same sub-directory/folder.

### Minimize Coupling

-   Coupling is the degree to which each module depends on other modules; a measure of how closely connected two modules are. We should strive to minimize coupling.
    <br>

-   Coupling is usually contrasted with cohesion. Low coupling often correlates with high cohesion and vice versa.
    <br>

-   Tightly coupled modules have the following disadvantages:

    -   Change in one module might break another module.
    -   Change in one module usually forces a ripple effect of changes in other modules.
    -   Reusability decreases as dependency over other modules increases.
    -   Assembly of modules might require more effort and/or time.
        <br>

-   Coupling can be reduced by:
    -   By hiding inner details and interacting through interfaces.
    -   Avoid interacting with classes that it can avoid directly dealing with.
    -   Components in a loosely coupled system can be replaced with alternative implementations that provide the same services.

### Law of Demeter / Principle of Least Knowledge

-   Code components should only talk to its direct relations and not to strangers.
    <br>

-   The Law of Demeter for functions requires that a method `m` of an object `a` may only invoke the methods of the following kinds of objects:

    -   `a` itself;
    -   `m`'s parameters;
    -   any objects instantiated within `m`;
    -   `a`'s attributes;
    -   global variables accessible by `a` in the scope of `m`.
        <br>

-   In particular, an object should avoid invoking methods of an object returned by another method. For many modern object-oriented languages that use a dot as a field identifier, the law can be stated simply as "**use only one dot**". That is, the code `a.m().n()` breaks the law where `a.m()` does not. As an analogy, when one wants a dog to walk, one does not command the dog's legs to walk directly; instead one commands the dog which then commands its own legs.

### Command-Query Separation

-   Command-Query Separation (CQS) states that every method should either be a command that performs an action, or a query that returns data to the caller, but not both. In other words, asking a question should not change the answer.
    <br>

-   **Query :** Returns a result without changing the state.
-   **Command :** Changes the state but does not return any value.
    <br>

-   This way the query method could be used anywhere without changing the data/state. We should apply naming conventions (get, set, add, etc.) to imply whether it is a command or a query.

# SOLID Design Principles

-   **SOLID Design Principles** are a set of five software design principles promoted by **Robert C. Martin (Uncle Bob)** in his paper "**[Design Principles and Design Patterns](https://web.archive.org/web/20191116231621/https://fi.ort.edu.uy/innovaportal/file/2032/1/design_principles.pdf)**".
    <br>

-   The SOLID principles aim to make software design easy to understand, maintain, and, flexible.
    <br>

-   The **SOLID Design Principles** are:
    -   **Single-responsibility principle :** "**There should never be more than one reason for a class to change.**" In other words, every class should have only one responsibility.
    -   **Open-Closed principle :** "**Software entities ... should be open for extension, but closed for modification.**"
    -   **Liskov substitution principle :** "**Functions that use pointers or references to base classes must be able to use objects of derived classes without knowing it**".
    -   **Interface segregation principle :** "**Many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface.**"
    -   **Dependency inversion principle :** "**Depend upon abstractions, [not] concretions.**"

## Single Responsibility Principle

-   The **Single Responsibility Principle** states that there should never be more than one reason for a class to change. In other words, every class should have only one responsibility.
    <br>

-   If there are two reasons to change a class then it has more than one responsibility and should be split. Having multiple reasons to change means that the module has high coupling.
    <br>

-   The more responsibilities your class has, the more often you'll need to change it. Since they won't be independent of each other, change to one responsibility may affect the other.

## Open-Closed Principle (OCP)

-   The **Open-Closed Principle** states that a software entity (class, module, function) should be open for extension but closed for modification. We should write our modules so that they can be extended, without requiring them to be modified.
    <br>

-   **Open for extension :** A class should be extensible, i.e., we should be able to make a class behave in different ways as new requirements come.
    <br>

-   **Closed for modification :** The extension should happen without any modification to the class.
    <br>

-   This can be achieved through **abstraction**, i.e., by creating interfaces. Interfaces should not change based on new requirements. Interfaces are extensible and new requirements can be taken care of by implementing classes.

## Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)

-   The **Liskov Substitution Principle** states that subclasses should be substitutable for their base classes. Derived classes should be substitutable for their base classes wherever the derived class is used.
    <br>

-   A client using a base class should continue to function properly even if a derived class is passed to it. This means that we should be able to pass an object of class B to any function that expects an object of class A given that class B is a subclass of class A.

## Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)

-   The **Interface Segregation Principle** states that many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface.
    <br>

-   Clients should not be forced to depend upon interfaces that they do not use. It is better to have smaller interfaces than fewer, fatter interfaces. An interface should be dependent more on the code that calls it rather than the code that implements it.
    <br>

-   Therefore, a class should be implementing different interfaces created based on the different types of clients. Each of these interfaces might have common methods as well.

## Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

-   The **Dependency Inversion Principle** states that "**Depend upon abstractions, [not] concretions**". This means that classes should depend on abstractions (interfaces) of other classes instead of the concrete implementations.
    <br>

-   The dependencies are inverted as the concrete classes depend upon abstractions instead of being dependent upon by other classes.

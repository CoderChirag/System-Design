# Requirement Engineering Process

-   Requirement Engineering is the process of defining, documenting and maintaining the requirements. It is a process of gathering and defining service provided by the system. It is a four-step process, which includes:
    -   Feasibility Study
    -   Requirement Elicitation and Analysis
    -   Software Requirement Specification
    -   Software Requirement Validation
    -   Software Requirement Management

## Feasibility Study

-   The main goal of this phase is to determine whether it would be financially and technically feasible to develop the software.
-   The feasibility study involves understanding the problem and then determining the various possible strategies to solve the problem.

## Requirement Elicitation and Analysis

-   Analysis of requirements starts with requirement elicitation. The requirements are analyzed to identify **inconsistencies**, **defects**, **omission**, etc. **We describe requirements in terms of relationships** and also resolve conflicts if any.

## Problems of Elicitation and Analysis

-   Getting all, and only, the right people involved.
-   Stakeholders often don't know what they want
-   Stakeholders express requirements in their terms.
-   Stakeholders may have conflicting requirements.
-   Requirement change during the analysis process.
-   Organizational and political factors may influence system requirements.

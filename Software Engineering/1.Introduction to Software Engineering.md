**Software** is a program or set of programs containing instructions that provide desired functionality.

**Engineering** is the process of designing and building something that serves a particular purpose and finds a cost-effective solution to problems.

**Software engineering** is the process of designing, developing, testing, and maintaining software. It is a systematic and disciplined approach to software development that aims to create high-quality, reliable, and maintainable software. Software engineering includes a variety of techniques, tools, and methodologies, including requirements analysis, design, testing, and maintenance.

## Characteristics of software in software engineering:

-   Software is **developed or engineered**; it is not manufactured in the classical sense:
    -   Although some similarities exist between software development and hardware manufacturing, few activities are fundamentally different.
-   The software doesn’t “**wear out.**”:
    -   There are no software spare parts.
    -   When a hardware component wears out, it is replaced by a spare part.
        The software continues to be custom-built:
    -   A software part should be planned and carried out with the goal that it tends to be reused in various projects.

## Key principles of Software Engineering

-   **Modularity :** Breaking the software into smaller, reusable components that can be developed and tested independently.
-   **Abstraction :** Hiding the implementation details of a component and exposing only the necessary functionality to other parts of the software.
-   **Encapsulation :** Wrapping up the data and functions of an object into a single unit, and protecting the internal state of an object from external modifications.
-   **Reusability :** Creating components that can be used in multiple projects, which can save time and resources.
-   **Maintenance :** Regularly updating and improving the software to fix bugs, add new features, and address security vulnerabilities.
-   **Testing :** Verifying that the software meets its requirements and is free of bugs.
-   **Design Patterns :** Solving recurring problems in software design by providing templates for solving them.
-   **Agile Methodologies :** Using iterative and incremental development processes that focus on customer satisfaction, rapid delivery, and flexibility.
-   **Continuous Integration & Deployment :** Continuously integrating the code changes and deploying them into the production environment.

## 4 Attributes of Software Engineering

-   **Efficiency**
-   **Reliability**
-   **Robustness**
-   **Maintainability**

**Software = Program + Documentation + Licensing**

## Evolving Role of Software - Dual Role of Software

Today, software takes on a dual role. It is a **product** and, at the same time, the **vehicle for delivering a product.**

### 1. As a product

-   Delivers the computing potential across networks of Hardware.
-   Enables the Hardware to deliver the expected functionality.
-   Acts as an information transformer because it produces, manages, acquires, modifies, displays, or transmits information.

### As a vehicle for delivering a product

-   Provides system functionality (eg, payroll system)
-   Controls other software (eg, an operating
    system)
-   Helps build other software (eg, software tools)

## Changing Nature of Software

The nature of software has changed a lot over the years.

The different types of softwares are :

-   **System Software :** collection of programs to provide service to other programs. eg, compilers, operating systems, editors, drivers etc
-   **Real time software :** softwares used to monitor, control, and analyze real world events as they occur. eg, softwares for weather forecasting etc.
-   **Embedded software :** place in "Read-Only-Memory (ROM)" of the product and control the various functions of the product. The product can be an aircraft, automobile, security system, signalling system, control unit of power plants, etc.
-   **Business software :** softwares designed to process business applications. eg, management information system, enterprise resource planning (ERP).
-   **Personal computer software** eg word processors, computer graphics, multimedia and animating tools, database management, computer games etc.
-   **Artificial intelligence software :** makes use of non numerical algorithms to solve complex problems that are not amenable to computation or straight forward analysis. eg, expert systems, artificial neural networkm signal processing software etc.
-   **Web based software :** software relate to web applications. eg, cgi, html, java, perl, dhtml etc.

## Legacy Software

**Legacy software** is software that has been around a long time and still fulfills a business need. It is mission critical and tied to a particular version of an operating system or hardware model (vendor lock-in) that has gone end-of-life. Generally the lifespan of the hardware is shorter than that of the software.

## Layered Technology of Software Engineering

Software engineering is a **fully layered technology**, to develop software we need to go from one layer to another. All the layers are connected and each layer demands the fulfillment of the previous layer.

1. **A quality focus :** It defines the continuous process improvement principles of software. It provides integrity that means providing security to the software so that data can be accessed by only an authorized person, no outsider can access the data. It also focuses on maintainability and usability.

2. **Process :** It is the foundation or base layer of software engineering. It is key that binds all the layers together which enables the development of software before the deadline or on time.  Process defines a framework that must be established for the effective delivery of software engineering technology. The software process covers all the activities, actions, and tasks required to be carried out for software development. 
   **Process activities are lsited below :**

    - **Communication :** It is the first and foremost thing for the development of software. Communication is necessary to know the actual demand of the client.
    - **Planning :** It basically means drawing a map for reduced the complication of development.
    - **Modeling :** In this process, a model is created according to the client for better understanding.
    - **Construction :** It includes the coding and testing of the problem.
    - **Deployment :** It includes the delivery of software to the client for evaluation and feedback.

3. **Methods :** During the process of software development the answers to all “**how-to-do**” questions are given by method. It has the information of all the tasks which includes communication, requirement analysis, design modeling, program construction, testing, and support.
4. **Tools :**  Software engineering tools provide a self-operating system for processes and methods. Tools are integrated which means information created by one tool can be used by another.

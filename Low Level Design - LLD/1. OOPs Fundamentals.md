# OOPs Fundamentals

## What is OOPs?

There are 2 techniques / paradigms of Programming :

-   **Procedural Programming :** Code written in form of functions.
-   **Object Oriented Programming :** Code written in forms of **Objects** and **Classes**.

### 4 Pillars of OOPs

-   **Inheritance :** Ability to inherit the properties of the parent.
-   **Polymorphism :** Ability to take different forms in different situations.
-   **Encapsulation :** Ability to encapsulate the code in modules (like capsules).
-   **Abstraction :** Ability to hide the non-required information and to show only the necessary information.

## Class (Blueprint)

-   Design / Type of an entity.
-   Have different **properties** (state) and **methods** (behaviour).
-   For eg, **Class Human :**
    -   **Properties :** hands, legs, eyes etc.
    -   **Methods :** eat, sleep, walk, think etc.

## Object

-   Instance of a **Class**.
-   **Class** occupies **Code Memory** only, but **Object** occupies **Heap Memory**.
-   **Constructor :** Initializes an Object.
    -   There are 2 types of **Constructors :**
        -   **No-arg Constructor :** Constructor which takes no argument. Default Constructor is also an no-arg constructor.
        -   **Parameterized Constructor :** Takes the specified parameters.
    -   Rules for a Constructor :
        -   No return type.
        -   Name same as Class name.
        -   Constructor **cannot** be marked as **abstract / static / final / synchronized.**
-   **Note :** Constructor implicitly returns the current instance of the class, but we can't make it return anything explicitly.

## `static` keyword

-   `static` data memebers or methods belongs to Class, rather than an Object, so they act like global for a class.
-   `static` data member or method can be accessed without creating an Object of the Class.
-   These require less space, than other data members and methods.
-   `static` method can access and update only the `static` data members and can call only a `static` method, but the normal data members and methods can access, update and call both `static` and `non-static`.

## `this` keyword

-   Represents the **current object.**
-   Can access **data members** (eg: `this.age`), **data methods** (eg: `this.sleep()`), and **constructor** (eg: `this()`) inside an object.

## Inheritance (Is-A Relationship)

-   Concept that acquires / inherits the properties and methods from one class to other classes. (eg: **Male**, and **Female** inherits from **Human**)
-   Types :
    -   **Single :** `Developer extends Employee`
    -   **Multilevel :** `Scorpio extends Mahindra`, `Mahindra extends Car`
    -   **Heirarchical :** `Intern extends Employee`, and `FulltimeEmployee extends Employee`
        ![types_of_inheritance](./assets/typesofinheritance.jpg)
    -   **Multiple :** One class extends 2 or more classes. Leads to ambiguity (eg: diamond problem). **Not allowed in JAVA**
    -   **Multiple :** One class extends 2 or more classes. Leads to ambiguity (eg: diamond problem). **Not allowed in JAVA**

## Polymorphism

-   Ability to take different forms.
-   2 Types :
    -   **Compile-time polymorphism :** **Method Overloading** (different functions having same name, but different parameters and return type). **Note :** In JAVA only changing return type is not allowed, we have to change the no. of parameters, or the type of parameters mandatiraly.
    -   **Run-time Polymorphism :** **Method Overriding** (different children having different implementations for the same parent method).
        -   **Rules :**
            -   Same function name and same parameters required.
            -   Must do Inheritance.
            -   Not allowed on Static Methods as they are bonded using static binding at compile time.
